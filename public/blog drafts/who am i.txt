hello out there!! ...can anyone hear me??

hello, i am polar. this is my website's first blogpost, allow me to introduce myself.

i am a loser who stays inside all day. I have not had a friend since elementary school and my life has progressively gotten more and more reclusive. 

why is this? idk.

anywho, this website is pretty much just for me to (when i get around to it) record my thoughts and to have a place to express stuff instead of letting it fester in my tiny lobotomized brain

now let me talk more about me because i am self absorbed

i have hobbies. 5 to be exact. Hobbies are probably why im not completely a wreck by now, and they are very fun (sometimes)

I play bass, I play guitar, I draw, I make animations, and most recently, I have been learning japanese for the last 2 weeks.

ok now for my villain manifesto about some opinion i stole from the internet

people generally are afraid of anything new or things they dont yet understand. This was useful when we were getting mutilated by saber tooth tigers and living in caves, but now it has lead to the rise of the concept of "cringe".

this is very bad. the concept of cringe in my opinion is the worst thing to ever exist, and whats even worse is we all revere this concept to some extent.
